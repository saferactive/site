# How the PCT works

---

## The first prototype of the PCT

- 1st prototype: Hackathon at ODI Leeds in February 2015

- We identifying key routes and mapped them

- For description of aims, see Lovelace et al. (2017)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npct/pct-team/master/figures/early.png")
```

<!-- ## Launched in 2017 -->

- Launched in 2017 with the Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy ([CWIS](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycling-and-walking-investment-strategy))

## The PCT in 2020

- Now the go-to tool for strategic cycle network planning in England and Wales, used by most local authorities with cycling plans ([source](https://npct.github.io/pct-shiny/regions_www/www/static/03d_other_reports/2019-use-of-pct-report.pdf)).

.pull-left[

## Geographic levels in the PCT


- Generate and analyse route networks for transport planning with reference to:
    - Zones
    - Origin-destination (OD) data
    - Geographic desire lines
    - Route allocation using different routing services
    - Route network generation and analysis

- MSOA areas have a population of 5-15k
- LSOAs have a population of 1-3k
- Route network data in PCT data based on LSOA data
- MSOAs can be useful for identifying key desire lines

## Estimating health benefits of cycling uptake with the PCT

- The PCT uses a modified version of the HEAT methodology to calculate health benefits of scenarios of change
- Based on the DfT's TAG methodology
- The scenarios are **what if** scenarios not forecasts 
- See the PCT manual for further information: [pct.bike/manual.html](https://npct.github.io/pct-shiny/regions_www/www/static/03a_manual/pct-bike-eng-user-manual-c1.pdf)

Reality

---

## Key stages of PCT approach

- Reproducible, open, scripted, enabling modifications, e.g.:
- Find short routes in which more people drive than cycle

--

- Stage 1: get data

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Aim: get top 1000 lines in repo
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
desire_lines_all = pct::get_pct_lines(region = "isle-of-wight")
desire_lines = desire_lines_all %>% 
  top_n(1000, all)
write_sf(desire_lines, "desire_lines.geojson")
piggyback::pb_upload("desire_lines.geojson")
```


```{r, message=FALSE}
# Set-up, after installing pct and checking out www.pct.bike:
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
desire_lines_all = pct::get_pct_lines(region = "isle-of-wight") %>% 
  top_n(n = 1000, wt = all)
```

---

## Stage II: Subset data of interest

- Interested only in major lines

```{r}
library(sf)
desire_lines = desire_lines_all %>% 
  filter(all > 50) %>% 
  select(geo_code1, geo_code2, all, bicycle, foot, car_driver, rf_dist_km)
plot(desire_lines)
```

---

## Stage III: Visualisation

<!-- A fundamental part of data science is being able to understand your data. -->

<!-- That requires visualisation, R is great for that: -->

```{r, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
.pull-left[
plot(desire_lines)
]
.pull-right[
]
```

<!-- - Interactively: -->

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(desire_lines) +
  tm_lines("all", scale = 9) +
  tm_basemap(server = leaflet::providers$OpenStreetMap)
```

---

## Stage IV: Origin-destination data analysis

- Now we have data in our computer, and verified it works, we can use it

- Which places are most car dependent? 

```{r}
car_dependent_routes = desire_lines %>% 
  mutate(percent_drive = car_driver / all * 100) %>% 
  filter(rf_dist_km < 3 & rf_dist_km > 1) 
```

- Get routes

```{r, eval=FALSE}
routes = stplanr::line2route(car_dependent_routes)
car_dependent_routes$geometry = routes$geometry
```

<!-- -- -->

<!-- - Any questions? -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- - Everyone happy with RStudio? -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Supporting reference materials -->

<!-- All interactive programming/analysis with command line interface involves frequent reference to documentation, and data science is no exception. Places to look for help (in roughly descending order): -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- - Your colleague -->
<!-- - R's internal help (e.g. with `?functonname` or `vignettes(package = "packagename)`) -->
<!-- - Online documentation, e.g. for the pct package: https://itsleeds.github.io/pct/  -->
<!-- - *Transport and Geographic Data Science with R*: An introduction to R aimed at transport planners: https://git.io/tds2dayex -->

<!-- - R for Data Science -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Exercises -->

<!-- - If you're happy with R, work through G1 to G8 in the [exercises](https://itsleeds.github.io/pct/articles/pct_training.html#exercises), starting: -->
<!--     - G1: Using the PCT's online interface, hosted at [www.pct.bike/m/?r=isle-of-wight](https://www.pct.bike/m/?r=isle-of-wight), identify the MSOA **zone** that has the highest number of people who cycle to work. -->

<!-- - If you're just getting started with RStudio: Work through Section 1 of https://git.io/tds2dayex -->

<!-- - Getting up to speed with data manipulation in the tidyverse: Work through and reproduce the code in Section [5.2](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#filter-rows-with-filter) of R for Data Science. -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # The PCT hackathon -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- Overall aim: generate ideas related to and extending the PCT -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- Ideas: -->

<!-- - Create a route network reflecting where you would invest if the priority was reducing car trips of less than 5 km -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- - Design interventions to replace short car trips across West Yorkshire (or another region of your choice) using the PCT methods/data to support your decisions -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- - Identify quiet routes and design a quiet route network for city/region of your choice, e.g. Leeds -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- - Import alternative origin-destination datasets and use those as the basis for propensity to cycle analysis for trip purposes other than single stage commutes, encapsulated in the commut layer in the PCT -->
<!-- - Any other layers/scenarios/hacks: welcome! Comments in this repo's [issue tracker](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/pct/issues) also welcome. -->

# Summary

Title: Propensity to Cycle Tool Advanced Training Workshop

Presenters: Dr Robin Lovelace and Dr Joey Talbot (University of Leeds)

This workshop will provide an overview of the PCT for advanced users, including:

- transport planners with experience of evidence-based prioritisation
- researchers with experience of using origin-destination, route and route network level data
- programmers, developers and others wanting to extend PCT methods for the public benefit

The workshop will be broken into three main parts:

- A 45 min talk plus demo of the tool and time for questions (which will be recorded for future use)
- A 45 minute tutorial in which I will demonstrate how the PCT works and how to extend analysis provided at www.pct.bike using R (requires R and RStudio to be installed and experience using command line computing tools)
- A 1 hour session where participants will use data from the PCT to tackle real-world problems in their local area

The Hopin platform will be used, enabling break-out sessions.

---

# Description: 

In this workshop you will take a deep dive into the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT).
Beginner and intermediate PCT events focus on using the PCT via the web application hosted at www.pct.bike and the data provided by the PCT in QGIS but the focus here is on analysing cycling potential in the open source statistical programming language R. The majority of the PCT was built on R, which is a powerful object-orientated programming language with a focus on statistical modelling, visualisation and geographic analysis. The workshop will show how the code underlying the PCT works, how the underlying data can be accessed for reproducible analysis, and how the methods can be used to generate new scenarios of cycling uptake.

---

# Preparation

If you are inexperienced with R you should prepare by

- Essential: taking an online course such as the free[ 'Introduction to R' course provided by DataCamp ](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)
- Essential: ensuring you have [installed](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) up-to-date versions of R (R 4.0.0 or greater), RStudio (1.2 or greater) and the pct R package (0.6.0) on your computer
- Essential: test your computer set up by running the R code here [github.com/ITSLeeds/pct/blob/master/inst/test-setup.R](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/pct/blob/master/inst/test-setup.R) - you should make a note of the result of this final commented-out command: `round(mean(rnet_potential$Potential))`
- Highly recommended: working through and reproducing results in Chapter 12 onwards of the open source book Geocomputation with R (see [geocompr.robinlovelace.net/transport.html](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/transport.html))

If you are new to R but have *not* completed the above tasks you may be unable to follow the second and third sections of the workshop outlined in the agenda below.

<!-- ## Transport planning software -->

<!-- Transport modelling software products are a vital component of modern transport planning *and* research. -->

<!-- - They generate the evidence base on which strategic investments are made and, furthermore, -->
<!-- - provide a powerful mechanism for researching alternative futures. -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- It would not be an overstatement to say that software determines the range of futures that are visible to policymakers. This makes status of transport modelling software and how it may evolve in the future important questions. -->

<!-- What will transport software look like? What will their capabilities be? And who will control? Answers to each of these questions will affect the future of transport systems.  -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- - Premise: transport planning/modelling software used in practice ~~will become~~ is becoming increasingly data-driven, modular and open.  -->
